    <h1>Technology policy</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. <br><br>There are several approaches to defining the substance and scope of <b>technology policy.</b></p>

    <p>According to the American scientist and policy advisor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_M._Branscomb">Lewis M. Branscomb</a>, technology policy concerns the "public means for nurturing those capabilities and optimizing their applications in the service of national goals and interests". Branscomb defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"> technology</a> in this context as "the aggregation of capabilities, facilities, skills, knowledge, and organization required to successfully create a useful service or product".<sup></sup></p>
    <p>Other scholars differentiate between technology policy and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_policy"> science policy</a>, suggesting that the former is about "the support, enhancement and development of technology", while the latter focuses on "the development of science and the training of scientists". Rigas Arvanitis, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_de_recherche_pour_le_d%C3%A9veloppement"> Institut de recherche pour le développement</a> in France, suggests that "science and technology policy covers all the public sector measures designed for the creation, funding, support and mobilisation of scientific and technological resources".</p>
    <p>Technology policy is a form of "active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_policy"> industrial policy</a>", and effectively argues, based on the empirical facts of technological development as observed across various societies, industries and time periods, that markets rarely decide industrial fortunes in and of their own and state-intervention or support is required to overcome standard cases of market-failure (which may include, for example, under-funding of Research & Development in highly competitive or complex markets).</p>
    <p>Technology policy may be more broadly defined, and <a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/faculty-a-z/michael-pollitt/"> Michael G. Pollitt</a> offers a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_approach"> multidisciplinary approach</a> with social science and humanities perspective on "good" policy.</p>

    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_management"> Technology management</a> at an policy or organisational level, viewed through the lens of complexity, involves the management of an inherently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system"> complex system</a>. Systems that are "complex" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinearity">nonlinearity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence"> emergence</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order"> spontaneous order</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"> adaptation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_loops"> feedback loops</a>, among others. According to Richard Cook, of the Cognitive technologies Laboratory at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago"> University of Chicago</a> "Complex systems are intrinsically hazardous systems. All of the interesting systems (e.g. transportation, healthcare, power generation) are inherently and unavoidably hazardous by the own nature. The frequency of hazard exposure can sometimes be changed but the processes involved in the system are themselves intrinsically and irreducibly hazardous. It is the presence of these hazards that drives the creation of defenses against hazard that characterize these systems." The success or failure of organisations or firms depends on the effective management of innovation through technology policy programmes </p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism"> Technological determinism</a> presumes that a society's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"> technology</a> drives the development of its social structure and cultural values. The term is believed to have been coined by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen"> Thorstein Veblen</a> (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Ayres"> Clarence Ayres</a> who was a follower of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen"> Thorstein Veblen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey"> John Dewey</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ogburn"> William Ogburn</a> was also known for his radical technological determinism.</p>
    <p>The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx"> Karl Marx</a>, whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_forces"> productive technology</a>, are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive. Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism. On the subject of technology as a means to liberation or enslavement, David Cooper wrote, "people myopically impressed by the world as an object of beauty or worship die out. Those who are myopically impressed by it as a source of energy do not: they even prosper".</p>
    <p>Although technological determinists believe in the continuous innovation of technology, many scientists believe that this innovation should be slowed down. For example, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"> artificial intelligence</a> gaining prominence throughout society, scientists fear that its potential of developing the cognitive skills of humans could force many individuals out of jobs and even put the lives of innocent people in danger. Most famously, scientist and entrepreneur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk"> Elon Musk</a> has is very public with the current progression of computing and AI; he believes that the fast rate at which artificial intelligence become smarter will place man in a vulnerable position where these newly created AI algorithms will identify humans as being expendable. Although extreme, Musk and many other remain cautious around the progression of artificial intelligence and other technological advances that may render the power of man and do the opposite of technological determinism by destroying societies.</p>

    <p>Technology policy takes an "evolutionary approach" to technical change, and hereby relates to evolutionary growth theory, developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Pasinetti"> Luigi Pasinetti</a>, J.S. Metcalfe, Pier Paolo Saviotti, and Koen Frenken and others, building on the early work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo"> David Ricardo</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=J.S._Metcalfe&action=edit&redlink=1"> J.S. Metcalfe</a> noted in 1995 that "much of the traditional economic theory of technology policy is concerned with so-called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure"> market failures</a>' which prevent the attainment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"> Pareto equilibria</a> by violating one or other of die conditions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition"> perfect competition</a>".</p>

    <p>It wasn't long until this policy statement's authority came into question when in 2008 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_Corp._v._FCC"> Comcast sued the FCC</a>. A federal court found that the FCC did not have the legal power to enforce the 2005 policy statement when they attempted to restrict Comcast from slowing its customers' connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent"> BitTorrent</a> due to it greatly contributing to piracy. This did not greatly impact the FCC's power, however, because in 2009 it forced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."> Apple</a> and AT&T to discontinue restricting its customers from making Skype calls. With the Comcast case looming over the FCC, it desired to restructure its rules to make them stronger in court and in 2010, under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama"> Obama administration</a>, it did just that.   </p>

    <p>One way governments use technology policy to their benefit is through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance"> mass surveillance</a> of its citizens. Nations around the globe use these technologies and certain polices to listen to people's phone calls, read emails and text messages, track citizens' GPS, and many more actions claiming to be improving national safety for their country.</p>
    <p> However, some nations will abuse their power of mass surveillance and inhibit the freedom of its citizens. Here are a few examples of nations currently employing mass surveillance:</p>

    <p>The Russian infiltrators did not stop there, when new information showed that someone attempted to breach the election system by viewing the state's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration_in_the_United_States"> voter-registration</a> database and stealing information on the registered voters. Additionally, Arizona received cyber-attacks from the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address"> IP addresses</a> that had been used in the previous Illinois attacks to install malware. Not long after, Jenkins found that many other states had received attacks from this same IP address and reports from the Senate Intelligence Committee that concluded Russia targeted every U.S. state.</p>
    <p>With this data, the company created personality profiles for the users and mapped their trends in likes and friends to direct certain ads toward the user. Considering that 62% of adults receive their news on social networks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"> Facebook</a>, Cambridge Analytica influenced the result of the election which leaves many wondering what role big data should have in the electoral process. Due to the influence that big data had in this election, the call to limit access to it and its usage has sparked a movement toward creating policy to restrict companies access to data called the "Great Privacy Awakening". In June 2018, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"> California</a> enacted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act"> California Consumer Privacy Act</a>, which states that companies must declassify what sort of data they collect and grant users the option to delete data. This leaves the rest of the U.S. watching to see the effectiveness of the California law in hopes to further protect U.S. citizens from becoming a victim to more unethical data practices.</p>
